        <h1>Intellectual Property: Bad for Students</h1>
        <h2>Complaints</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Intellectual property has done more harm than good for standardized exams.</li>
          <li>Standardized exams are gatekeepers to elite universities and professions. It is in the public 
interest that preparation materials are high quality and available to all.</li>
          <li>Intellectual property contributes to the pay to win ecosystem surrounding standardized exams and 
the lack of innovative applications in EdTech.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
          Create educational content as Markdown files. Standardized exams as JSON.
          </li>
          <li>
          Distribute under open source licenses. Ideally public domain.
          </li>
          <li>
          Build open source software.
          </li>
        </ol>
